# GPU

- `amdgpu.nix`: AMD driver stack + Vulkan/ROCm components.
- `nvidiagpu.nix`: NVIDIA stack with open kernel module and beta package selection.

## Discord and Discord Canary NVENC

The `desktop` host installs Discord and Discord Canary with Vencord through
`packages/common.nix`. Both packages are wrapped so the clients start with
`/run/opengl-driver/lib` in
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, exposing the NVIDIA libraries needed by the screen-sharing
patch.

Both Discord packages are also patched at Nix build time, directly against the
`index.js` shipped by their current packaged versions. The
configuration does not copy the full upstream patcher `index.js`, because that
file may target a different Discord client version.

The contextual patch applies only the behavior observed in
`relativemodder/discord-linux-vulkan-video-patcher`:

- `setTransportOptions` removes `vaapi` from video experiments and adds
  `linux-nvenc` + `useCaptureDeviceForEncode` on Linux;
- `setDesktopSourceWithOptions` forces `useCaptureDeviceForEncode = true` on
  Linux;
- `createVoiceConnectionWithOptions` adds `linux-vulkan` to connection
  experiments on Linux.

Each replacement is strict: if the expected anchor is missing or appears more
than once, the build fails. In that case, inspect the new packaged
`discord_voice/index.js` and adjust the minimal patch anchors instead of copying
a complete upstream file.

`gpu_encoder_helper` and `discord_voice.node` remain executable. There is no user
service and nothing automatically mutates `~/.config/discord` or
`~/.config/discordcanary`.

### Migrating from the old user service

If the old `discord-nvenc-patch` service already ran, it may have replaced the
`~/.config/discord/*/modules/discord_voice` or
`~/.config/discordcanary/*/modules/discord_voice` symlink with a local copy. In
that case, remove the local version directory after rebuilding so Discord
recreates it from the patched Nix package:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.config/discord/0.0.* ~/.config/discordcanary/1.0.*
```

Adjust the version numbers if Discord has changed.
